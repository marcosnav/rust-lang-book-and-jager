# 1.2 Resume

The `main()` function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

`println!` is a macro. Macros can be distinguished from functions with the `!`. More about macros in Chapter 19.

To compile the program:
`$ rustc main.rs`

To run the program:
`$ ./main`
